# Extracting_and_Visualizing_Data_in_Python
Final Project using Webscraping Techniques and various Python Libraries 
Final Project where I used Webscraping and Python Libraries to download webpages and read the html code. Then using BeautifulSoup to read the html code as text and create Data Frames that I could then manipulate to extract stock data for Tesla and GameStop. Finally, I used the extracted data to then make useful and easy to understand visualizations.
